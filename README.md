# Arduino DAC Multiport

This is an Arduino program to run a 6Bit DAC using a [R2R
ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor_ladder)

The code is a slight modified version of a previously existing one that adds the
ability to use pins from different ports instead of all the pins from the same
port.
